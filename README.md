This repository is used for MHS Genesis projects and knowledge.

## Requesting or proposing a project
1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/DavidAlt/MHSG/issues/new) with the name of the project and a brief description.
1. Assign the "proposal" label.
1. Assign the "Project Tracker" label.

The proposal will automatically move to the "Proposed" section on the [Project Tracker](https://github.com/DavidAlt/MHSG/projects/5) board. From there, you can move it to the "Approved" or "In Progress" lists as applicable.

## Adding tasks to an existing project
1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/DavidAlt/MHSG/issues/new)
1. Assign labels as necessary
1. Assign it to the relevant project

If a project board has already been created for that project, the issue should automatically move to the "To Do" list.

## Creating a new project board

1. Click "Create Project"
1. Remember to create an issue to track the project on the [Project Tracker](https://github.com/DavidAlt/MHSG/projects/5)! *("Requesting or proposing a project")*

## When should a project have its own repository?
Project-specific repositories are good when you want to split a large project into smaller subprojects. 

Example: The [Note Development Roadmap](https://github.com/DavidAlt/MHSG/projects/1) project's goal is to understand the **process** and **mechanics** of developing notes from start to finish. Once the roadmap is available, it will be used to develop **content** for individual departments. Splitting this into multiple projects (Process, Content, OT/PT Content, Developmental Peds Content, etc) would make it easier to manage a large number of tasks, especially if multiple people are working on it. It also helps keep the MHSG repository clean. Once the project is complete, that information can be documented on the MHSG wiki and the project-specific repository can be closed.
